    <h1>Level 3-1</h1>
    <p>Yay! We've successfully gotten Bob to work - very painfully, though. Unfortunately, since Bob spent ages driving to work (unless you skipped the level by pressing the next button early), Bob's boss is now yelling at him for being 2 hours late.</p>
    <p>Hang on, lemme get to my "Angry Speech Generator"...</p>
    <h6>Censored for younger audiences.</h6>
    <p>Bob's Boss: You're [REDACTED] late again, you [REDACTED] piece of [REDACTED]! I don't even [REDACTED] know why I [REDACTED] hired you! You're such a [REDACTED] lazy, [REDACTED] stupid worker! [REDACTED] you, you [REDACTED] piece of [REDACTED]!! [REDACTED] you! [REDACTED] you! [REDACTED] you! [REDACTED] you!</p>

    <p>Hang on, that's more angry than usual. Oops! I forgot to turn down the age filter. Sorry!</p>
